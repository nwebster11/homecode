Gym.py: Generates a printable list of weight training exercises to take to the gym. 
Exercises are randomly selected with user-specified preferences, and weight progress is stored.  
A database of exercises and muscle groups is referenced and user-specific values are retrieved. 

Tournament.java: Performs a double elimination tournament to select from a plaintext list of items.
At each round, the user is presented with a random selection until the winner has been determined.
